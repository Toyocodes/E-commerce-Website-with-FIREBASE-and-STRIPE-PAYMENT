# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

Major challenge
* Getting to use useContext hooks for the first time, it was quite difficult for me to understand the usage but I was able to figure it out with the help of resources online.
* Getting the cart to function was quite a lot for me considering the fact that it was my first time doing this kind of project using Reactjs and REST API.

Note: Fakestore API was used (https://fakestoreapi.com/products)
